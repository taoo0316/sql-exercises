There are three types of SQL Commands: Data Definition Language (DDL), Data Manipulation Language (DML) and Data Control Language (DCL).

*DDL: CREATE, DROP, ALTER*

**DML: SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE**

*DCL: COMMIT, ROLLBACK, GRANT, REVOKE*

In reality, 90% of SQL commands belong to DML, which is the focus of this repository.
